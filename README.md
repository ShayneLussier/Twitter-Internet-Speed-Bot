PROMISED_DOWN = 1500

compose_tweet.send_keys(tweet)
```

## Warning

If selenium crashes when launching a browser, it might be because it can't find the path to your webdriver in your directory. Fix with the following code:
```python
from selenium import webdriver

# Path to your WebDriver
driver_path = '/path/to/your/webdriver'
# Initialize the browser driver (for example, Chrome)
driver = webdriver.Chrome(executable_path=driver_path) 
```
